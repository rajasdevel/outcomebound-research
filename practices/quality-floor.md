# Quality floors: format, lint, type, secret and shell checks as a gate

> **Own results.** Claims marked (O) record the maintainers' own audit of one floor they built and ran. They are one project's observations, not a sample, and the records are not published ([CONVENTIONS](../CONVENTIONS.md)). The tool documentation and the other measurements are general.

What format, lint, type, secret and shell checks catch when run as a gate that blocks new problems
without demanding a clean tree first, and how to build and fit one.

Re-check when a tool named in §8 or §11 ships a new major or minor version, or a floor is fitted to
a new stack. The tool documentation in Sources was read on 2026-09-13;
facts added later carry their own date (`read 2026-10-01`, or `[as-of]`).

This reference collects what is known about running format, lint, type, secret and shell checkers as
a floor that blocks new problems without demanding a clean tree first: what such a floor catches
and misses, how baselines work and what they cost, what strict typing measures on unannotated code,
why a floor should run the project's own tool configuration, how to detect a loosening, how to fit a
floor to a project that already has findings and secrets, and how individual tools behave when read
by a machine. It is for anyone adding such a gate to a project, building one for agents to work
under, or judging whether one earns its upkeep.

**Evidence classes.** (M) measured in the named repository; (L) tool documentation, or tool
behaviour observed on the named version; (P) practitioner consensus; (A) one observation; (O) an
observation made by the maintainers on a floor they built. Most
measurements come from one place. "The audited floor" is a floor that the maintainers ran for eleven
days in the CI of "the audited repository", a standard-library Python codebase of about 60,000
lines; both were audited afterwards with ruff 0.16.7 and mypy 2.3.1. Bracketed
ids resolve in
[`_evidence/2026-09-25.jsonl`](../_evidence/2026-09-25.jsonl).

## Key findings

**Q1. A floor catches its rules' defect classes, cheaply; it does not catch state, drift or a model's
judgment.** In the audited repository no commit message records a behaviour defect the floor
caught; what worked was three claims taking about 11 s in CI: a format gate that keeps diffs clean,
and lint and type baselines that block new findings. State and drift, such as deployed state that
differs from the repository, are outside what source checks see; §1 names checks that reach some of
it. (M, A)

**Q2. Untuned rule sets are mostly noise.** In the audited repository 49% of 1,078 lint findings were
two subprocess rules (ruff S603/S607), 467 of them in tests; the commits they caused added 238 `noqa`
suppression lines. In the audit's retuning, rules were selected by the defect class they catch: the `shell=True`
family (S602, S604, S605) stayed, S603/S607 went, and the unused-import and redefinition residue
was fixed. (M)

**Q3. Strict typing on unannotated code measures annotation completeness.** Of 5,161 mypy findings
under `strict`, 94% were three annotation rules (`no-untyped-def` 2,308, `no-untyped-call` 2,201,
`type-arg` 333) and 73% were in tests; non-strict with `check_untyped_defs` reported 265, and a sample
of the findings outside tests were idioms or false positives. `no-untyped-call` makes new code that
calls old code a new finding. The retuning used basic mode with `check_untyped_defs` and required annotations only
on the shipped package. (M)

**Q4. A baseline is keyed by path, rule and normalized message, counted as a multiset, and kept as
readable text.** Line numbers break identity on every insertion; absolute paths made it differ
between two checkouts (0 of 686 identities shared); a set lets a second identical finding through.
Baselines kept as 64-bit hashes could not be read by a person, were never tightened, and accumulated
1,784 stale lines out of 6,945. A sorted `path:rule:message` file tightens by deleting lines and
shows a loosening as added lines in a diff. (M, A)

**Q5. A floor that renders its own tool configuration shadows the project's own.** A floor
that rendered its own mypy config checked other files than the project's config named, and passed at
gate while the project's own mypy run reported the error (observed once); a rendered `mypy.ini`
written at the project's own path overwrites the project's file and is read back as the project's
targets; a rendered `ruff.toml` shadows a project's own settings and misses configs in parent
directories. (A)

**Q6. A loosening is visible only against the base, read from Git; preventing one needs the host.**
A comparison of the floor's files at the base ref with the candidate shows it: a baseline that
gained a line, a changed tool config, a new suppression comment, a new allowlist entry, a removed or
weakened check. The old side is read from Git, not from the working tree the diff could rewrite. A commit trailer can acknowledge a
loosening, but the same agent can edit the check; prevention needs server-side branch protection with
required review, and on a private repository on GitHub's free plan branch protection is not
available, so a `CODEOWNERS` line there guards nothing. (A, L) [as-of 2026-09-28]

**Q7. An existing project can be fitted by recording what is there and gating each change.** The
pattern recorded existing findings when the floor was fitted and failed on new ones; a secret was
never recorded but rotated or allowlisted by fingerprint, a change the loosening check reads; secret
scans covered only commits since the fitting, with a check that the fitting commit is an ancestor.
In the implementation probed, the first check after fitting read PASS on every claim fitted, with each
secret-shaped finding listed once for triage and the type claim left out because mypy stopped on a
duplicate module name; a change adding findings failed format and lint. (A)

**Q8. A run that analyzed nothing is not a pass.** Tools exit 0 with an empty report after reading
nothing (ruff excluding every file over 206 Python files; import-linter with zero contracts; a bats
loop over an empty list); several tool families exit non-zero for reasons unrelated to findings.
The safeguards are completion keyed on something the tool printed, a count of the files measured,
and a reading of zero files, a timeout, an unparsed report or an unexpected exit status as
UNVERIFIED. (A, L)

**Q9. A minimum tool version works better than an exact pin, and a missing tool stays visible.** Exact pins
turned claims UNVERIFIED on patch drift (bash 5.2.21 on the CI runner against a 5.3 pin); patch-level
interpreter pins did the same on other machines. A tool missing when the floor is fitted stays as an
UNVERIFIED claim and does not disappear from the floor. (A)

**Q10. Parser fixtures that are not captured from the real tool prove only consistency with themselves.** In one floor 61 of its 85 shipped
claims had hand-written parser fixtures (all 12 SQL, 12 of 13 PHP, 10 of 12
TypeScript); a home-grown shell parser misread `done < <(…)` and reported three false findings on
scripts `bash -n` accepts. Passing fixture comparisons establish consistency with the fixtures, not
correctness on the tool. (M, A)

**Q11. Line-count ceilings measure size, not defects, and invite splitting to fit.** Thirty files
sat over a 900-line ceiling while CI printed PASS; a module split to get under it grew back past it
fourteen minutes later unflagged; splits left 21- and 31-line modules. Function-size rules (ruff
C901, PLR0912/PLR0913/PLR0915) already bound what matters. (M)

**Q12. Observe-only and unprovisioned claims produce rows, not actions.** In the audited floor,
observe-mode claims produced one action in 11 days, undone 14 minutes later; claims whose tools were
never provisioned read UNVERIFIED in every report. The audit's remedy was to gate the few claims that catch something and drop
the rest. (M)

**Q13. A floor's own machinery can outweigh what it checks.** The audited floor, about 15,800 lines
with about 18,200 lines of tests, delivered three claims that took 11 s; a design of about
1,000–1,500 lines delivers the same. (M)

**Q14. Secret scanning leaks the secret unless every output is redacted.** Counts that print matching
lines, verbatim logs, parser notes and exception text can all carry it. The remedies seen are
redacting every string, keying a finding on the rule id rather than the message, and keeping secrets
out of committed policy. (A)

**Q15. Pinning a check's definition does not pin what it runs.** With the definition unchanged,
the script it invoked was edited from exit 1 to exit 0 and the run still read PASS. Pinning and verifying
every input the verdict depends on (script, checker module, configuration), before the run and
after every command, closes the gap. (O)

## 1. What a floor catches and misses (Q1, Q12)

**The audited floor, claim by claim** (from its CI floor report and a local run):

| Claim (mode) | What it caught | What it cost | Audit's conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `format` (gate), `ruff format --check` | no defect class; keeps diffs clean; 0 findings, 0.11 s | 4 format-only fix-up commits in 5 days, each fixed by one command | keep; run the formatter before committing |
| `lint` (baseline), ruff | 1,078 findings: S603/S607 531 (49%), 467 of them in tests; 249 auto-fixable (169 safe); 113 complexity; pyflakes residue (F811 25, F401 19, F841 6). It caught a complexity finding plus a subprocess finding in a test, and a complexity finding drove a real refactor. No behaviour bug recorded | 238 suppression comments for S603/S607; a second identical subprocess call in a file became a new finding; code shaped so a function would not grow | keep, retuned: about 378 findings after dropping S603/S607 and applying the 169 safe auto-fixes, 217 outside tests |
| `types` (baseline, strict), mypy | 5,161 findings, 94% annotation completeness, 73% in tests; four sampled findings outside tests were idioms or false positives | 6 commits added only annotations ("175 findings… all missing annotations"); CI had to install pytest beside mypy so mypy could resolve the suite's imports | keep, retuned: 265 findings in basic mode with `check_untyped_defs`, 98 outside tests |
| `module-lines` (observe, 900) | none: a size proxy | 30 files over the ceiling with CI printing PASS; splits and regrowth (Q11) | drop |
| `structure` (observe) | four real rot checks: tracked scratch state, dangling in-progress markers, documented scripts that must exist, entry points that must answer `--help`; run by hand, 1 of 4 failed (two fixture scripts exit 1 on `--help`) | none, because it never ran, so its failure was invisible | gate it (about 3 s) |
| `secrets` (gitleaks) | a real defect class | never ran: not provisioned in CI or locally | provision and gate at zero |
| `advisories` (osv-scanner), `unused-dependencies` (deptry), `lockfile-present` | nothing to catch in a standard-library-only runtime with no lockfile; the lockfile script reported `files=0` | permanent UNVERIFIED rows | drop here |
| `dead-code` (vulture) | 43 findings; of the 12 at 100% confidence, 11 were pytest fixture parameters used for their side effects and 1 an unused parameter; 31 at 60% | never ran in CI | run by hand at `--min-confidence 100` when cleaning up |
| `tests`, `coverage`, `mutation` (observe) | `tests` duplicated the project's own test command; coverage and mutation never ran | none | drop here |
| `shell.syntax` (`bash -n`) | parse errors in 31 scripts the suite already executes | UNVERIFIED in CI because the runner's bash 5.2.21 was not the pinned 5.3 | unpin, or drop |
| `shell.format` (shfmt) | — | UNVERIFIED everywhere; shfmt not installed | drop |
| `shell.function-lines` (60), `script-lines` (900) | function-lines' own parser misread `done < <(…)` and reported 3 false "unterminated" findings; all 31 shell files together were 1,931 lines | noise in every CI report | drop |
| `shell.injection` (`curl \| sh` and `eval` patterns) | the injection class; 0 findings in 31 files, 0.35 s | none | keep, gated while at zero |

A structure check that finds scripts by walking the filesystem (`rglob("*.py")`) executes what the
project does not own: scripts in a virtual environment, a build directory, or another checkout
nested in the tree and hidden from Git by `.git/info/exclude` (one such check ran a nested
worktree's copies with `--help`). Walking what Git tracks (`git ls-files -z`) avoids this, with an empty listing
(no repository, no Git, nothing tracked) read as UNVERIFIED, never as a pass; without `-z`, Git quotes a
path holding a non-ASCII byte (`"bin/na\303\257ve.py"`), and a reader that does not unquote it skips
that script in silence (A, git 2.55.0) [as-of 2026-09-23].

Two ways a floor's own guidance can undo it (A). In one observed run, an agent given a floor's
guidance with its list of tool commands ran the listed tools itself and reported every claim
UNVERIFIED; naming the one command that runs the floor first, and saying that the list is never a
substitute, answers it, since a tool run by hand establishes no floor verdict. And an observe-only
plan listed among required checks marked every run UNVERIFIED, and a generic CI script under `set
-euo pipefail` failed every run on its exit status; keeping observe-only checks out of required
checks, saying in their guidance that they gate nothing, and letting only the UNVERIFIED exit through
where CI runs one, answers that.

**What a floor does not establish.** That a model writes better code; anything about a tool run by
hand; that a lockfile or a declared schema validator is consistent or enforced rather than present;
deployed state; a rule nobody selected; anything the project's own branch protection does not cover.
Nor, per stack (A, reasoning from the tools' behaviour, not run on the tools): that clippy, `cargo
check` or a dead-code lint covered any target, feature or build tag they were not run with; that
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` says anything about dependencies; that a PHP project's ORM migrations are
SQL files a migration linter can read; that sqlx's compile-time query check ran at all without its
recorded query cache or a database to check against; or that formatting and linting a notebook
establishes its execution order, clean outputs, data lineage or numerical reproducibility.
A report should keep apart: edited, formatted, lint-clean, type-clean, tests collected, tests passing,
covered on changed lines, committed.

**Checks that reach some state a source floor misses** include: rendering the same
artifact under two different `PYTHONHASHSEED` values in independent processes and comparing bytes
(two renders with the same seed prove nothing); treating a skipped test as a finding, not a pass;
and measuring final identifiers in UTF-8 bytes against the target's limit (PostgreSQL allows 63
bytes, so a 60-character name can be 66 bytes). Drift against a deployed environment needs that
environment's credentials, which a repository floor does not hold.

**Guidance behind floors.** The cited sources advise: when documentation fails to hold a rule, promote it into code (custom
linters, structural tests) [deterministic-1] (L); write the lint's message to carry the fix
[deterministic-2] (L); map each written guideline to a lint rule so "lint green" is the definition of
done [deterministic-19] (A); never send a model to do a linter's job [practitioners-9] (P); enforce
style with linters and formatters rather than instruction text [other-labs-12] (P); treat
verification as a ladder, catching each class at the cheapest deterministic rung first
[practitioners-15] (P); rules that must always hold go into hooks or permissions, not prose
[anthropic-16] (L).

## 2. Rule selection and typing strictness (Q2, Q3)

- ruff: in a Python codebase that shells out, S603/S607 (subprocess with non-literal argv, program by
  relative name) produced 550 findings and E501 196 in one count; `[lint.per-file-ignores]` used as a
  baseline is file-scoped, so a new violation of a rule the file already ignores is suppressed too,
  and the gate protects new files, not new lines. `--add-noqa` inserts source comments; it does not
  create a baseline file. PLR0915 counts statements, not lines, so a 118-line function was not
  flagged. A configuration used as a Python floor: line length 100, target py310, select `E, F, W, I,
  UP, B, SIM, C4, PIE, RET, RUF, C901, PLR0912, PLR0913, PLR0915, PERF, S`, max complexity 10, max
  arguments 6, max branches 12, max statements 50, tests ignoring `S101, PLR0915, PLR0913`. (M, L)
- mypy under `--strict`, tried module by module on the audited repository's package: 1 of 43
  modules clean, 1,242 errors outside the checked boundary; a type gate over one clean module
  establishes almost nothing.
  Replacing the boundary with the whole tree plus a baseline gave 1,289 identities over 6,865
  findings. The debt could not gate; the formatter could. The shape the audit settled on: basic mode plus
  `check_untyped_defs`, with `disallow_untyped_defs` for the shipped package only, then a ratchet.
  `follow_imports = silent` for modules outside the checked set is narrower than taking on their
  strict findings, and is named debt. (M)
- Other stacks' type checks: PHPStan at `--level max` with strict rules is PHP's type check and runs
  as lint; TypeScript uses `tsc --noEmit` against a floor tsconfig extending the project's with strict
  flags; clippy runs with `-D warnings`; `go vet` is a heuristic analyzer, not a strict type mode.
  Weakening `strict`, `noImplicitAny` or `strictNullChecks` in a generated tsconfig is a loosening a
  byte comparison catches. (L)
- TypeScript in more detail (L, [typescript-eslint
  configs](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs/) and [typed
  linting](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/), read 2026-10-01): the
  `strict` and `strict-type-checked` configurations are 'not considered "stable" under Semantic
  Versioning', so their rules can change outside a major release; the project service throws an
  error for a file its nearest tsconfig does not include unless the file is allowlisted in
  `allowDefaultProject`; type checking is switched off for a `files` match such as `**/*.js` with
  `disableTypeChecked`, since tsconfigs include JavaScript only with `allowJs` or `checkJs`; and
  `stylistic-type-checked` adds rules beside the strict set rather than replacing it, so leaving it
  out keeps style to the formatter. `tsc --noEmit` does not cover Vue or Svelte templates
  (`vue-tsc`, `svelte-check` do), framework-generated types or the production bundle. A floor
  tsconfig that extended the project's added `noEmit`, `strict`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noImplicitOverride`, `noImplicitReturns`,
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `useUnknownInCatchVariables`,
  and its ESLint half of complexity was `complexity` 10, `max-depth` 4, `max-params` 6,
  `max-statements` 50 and `max-lines` 900; biome was kept only as a substitute formatter, having no
  counterpart to the typed rules (A, a configuration never run against the tools).
- Other analyzers (L, read 2026-10-01): Clippy's documentation says the `restriction` group "should,
  emphatically, not be enabled as a whole", so a floor names the lints it adopts; automated
  accessibility tests such as axe through Playwright "can detect some common accessibility
  problems", while "many accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing";
  ArchUnit checks dependency and layering rules someone wrote down, not whether that architecture is
  right; Staticcheck, Error Prone and Semgrep rules each check named bug patterns.

## 3. Baselines and finding identity (Q4)

**Identity.**

- The identity that held up keys a finding on rule, path relative to the component root, and a
  content anchor (the enclosing symbol or the normalized message), with line and column kept only for
  display. A test that shifted every line by seven proved identities stable. Paths need normalizing
  (a leading `./` names the same file as none); ruff's
  JSON reports absolute filenames, so two checkouts of one tree at different paths shared 0 of 686
  identities and a baseline could not travel to CI.
- Normalization that worked: lower-case, collapse whitespace, strip `line 42`, `column 7`, `l.12`,
  `:12:4` and the leftover punctuation, keep other numbers (rule codes, lengths, counts). Hashing the
  exact bytes mattered: a helper that stripped trailing whitespace mapped three distinct findings to two ids.
- Anchors by tool type: formatters (prettier, php-cs-fixer, rustfmt, gofumpt, `go mod tidy -diff`) on
  the path, and prettier reports only the path, so it cannot run in baseline mode; dependency and
  advisory tools (osv-scanner, cargo-deny, govulncheck) on the package or module name with the version
  in the locator, so upgrading to a fixed release retires the finding; tests on the test name; secrets
  on the rule id; architecture tools on the edge or layer pair; unused-symbol tools on the symbol;
  squawk on the rule name, because its messages quote SQL.
- Some tools keep a native baseline: PHPStan writes one with `--generate-baseline`, and golangci-lint
  reports only issues new since a revision with `issues.new-from-rev` (L, [PHPStan
  baseline](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/baseline) and [golangci-lint configuration](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/configuration/file/),
  read 2026-10-01); ruff's `--add-noqa` writes suppression comments, not a baseline. ESLint,
  from 9.24.0, records existing violations in `eslint-suppressions.json` with `--suppress-all` or
  `--suppress-rule` and drops resolved ones with `--prune-suppressions`; vulture's
  `--make-whitelist` writes the current findings as a file later runs read, which serves as one.
  mypy, clippy and knip document none: mypy suppresses existing errors by module (`ignore_errors`)
  or by line (an inline ignore comment), clippy by lint level, and knip's command line has no baseline
  option (L, [ESLint bulk suppressions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/suppressions),
  [vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture), [mypy, using mypy with an existing
  codebase](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/existing_code.html), [Clippy
  configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/configuration.html), [knip
  CLI](https://knip.dev/reference/cli), read 2026-10-01). A floor that keys every tool on one
  identity scheme reads them all the same way; one built on native baselines inherits each tool's
  own idea of what is new.
- Count-bearing messages (ruff's `` `_main` is too complex (17 > 10) ``): the measurement is dropped from
  the anchor and the count stored as a magnitude, `<id> <count>`, paired per identity, largest first;
  the same function made simpler passes and lowers the count; a higher count has grown. E501 and
  W505 keep the count in the anchor, because a line has no name to pair it with. If the anchor
  carries the number, any change to the function's complexity is a new identity and splitting the
  function is the only way to retire it. ruff's `PLR0912`, `PLR0913` and `PLR0915` messages name no
  function (`Too many branches (18 > 12)`, `Too many arguments in function definition (15 > 6)`,
  `Too many statements (88 > 50)`), so with the count taken out their anchors pair one file's
  occurrences by count alone; counted rules match by the whole code (`C901`, `PLR09` and two
  digits), so that `XC901` or `PLR09111` is not counted (L, ruff 0.16.7 output) [as-of 2026-09-23].
  Other stacks carry the count in the message too: ESLint `Method 'render' has a complexity of 14.
  Maximum allowed is 10.`, golangci-lint ``cyclomatic complexity 14 of func `handle` is high (>
  10)``, phpmd `The method render() has a Cyclomatic Complexity of 17.` (hand-written fixtures,
  UNVERIFIED on the tools).

**Counting.**

- A baseline is a multiset: one line per accepted occurrence, and a second identical finding beyond
  the accepted count is new. Two F841 findings (`x = 1` in `a()`, `x = 2` in `b()`) shared one
  normalized identity, and a set baseline holding it once passed both.
- Limits of message-keyed multisets: deleting one recorded finding and adding a same-key finding
  elsewhere in the file passes by count; a moved file reads as new findings plus stale ones (three
  new, three stale in a probe); a same-key finding added elsewhere in the same file fails, as it
  should.
- An aggregate count ceiling passes when one old error is deleted and one new one added, and a lower
  count can hide a more severe new defect; a tool with no stable identity has only an
  aggregate debt ceiling, which cannot see that.
- An absent or unreadable baseline is not an empty one: in baseline mode it reads UNVERIFIED with a
  remedy, never "every existing finding is new". Baselines keyed by component and claim keep one
  component's baseline from absorbing another's debt.

**Keeping it honest.**

- The ratchet only shrinks: it writes, per identity, the lesser of the recorded and the observed
  count and lowers ceilings to what was observed; never from a capped list (reports capped at 50
  findings per claim) or from a parser that reports no count. In one run 88 of 1,289 type identities
  retired.
- A baseline is established only when its absence is the run's sole problem: tool identity verified, run
  completed, a supported exit status, a positive count of files measured, evidence saved.
- Adding an exclusion and then ratcheting launders reduced inspection into apparent improvement; tool,
  parser and config updates change counts without any code change.
- The rule in the audited floor was that agents fix a new finding or suppress it inline with a
  reason, never add a baseline line, and may tighten freely.
- Baselines are written claim by claim: one optional tool nobody had installed made an
  all-or-nothing ratchet refuse every baseline in the audited repository (O). A baseline for each claim that verified, the rest listed by name, and provisioning tool
  by tool answer it.
- A sorted plain-text file of `path:rule:message` lines, without line or column, is readable, diffable
  and shrinks by deletion. Opaque hashed baselines in the audited floor were touched by 3 commits in
  11 days, none a tightening, and hid 98 real-looking type errors outside tests.

## 4. Tool configuration: run the project's own (Q5)

- In the cases that held, each tool runs from the project root with the project's own configuration;
  ruff, mypy and gitleaks find theirs. A rendered configuration silently shadows the project's wherever the tool would read
  it (`.eslintrc*`, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]`, `setup.cfg` `[mypy]`, `package.json`
  `eslintConfig`). Shadowing can pass a gate the project's own configuration fails (Q5). A rendered
  `mypy.ini` written at the project's own path overwrites the project's file, and the next render
  reads the floor's copy back as the project's targets (`files = src` becomes `files = .`), losing
  the original. A floor that must add settings can detect the native config, refuse without explicit
  consent per tool, never merge, and never read its own file back as native (inference).
- Where each tool looks: mypy reads the first of `mypy.ini`, `.mypy.ini`, `pyproject.toml`
  `[tool.mypy]` and `setup.cfg` `[mypy]`, and only one, walking up from the working directory to the
  repository root and then trying user-level files (L, [mypy configuration
  file](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html), read 2026-10-01); its targets are
  `files` and `packages` (a package name resolves through the module roots) and `mypy_path` adds
  roots. In mypy's source, `defaults.py` lists `CONFIG_NAMES` (`mypy.ini`, `.mypy.ini`) and
  `SHARED_CONFIG_NAMES` (`pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`), and `config_parser._find_config_file`
  returns the first that carries a mypy section, whether or not it names `files`; `mypy -v` logs the
  file it read on its `Config File:` line (L, mypy source read 2026-10-01). A floor that read
  `setup.cfg` before `pyproject.toml`, and skipped a first config that named no targets, passed its
  type check at gate over `legacy/` while mypy's own run checked `src/` and reported an error there
  (A, mypy 2.3.1) [as-of 2026-09-24]. Taking targets from the first config mypy itself reads, and letting
  one that names none keep the component root rather than borrow another file's targets, avoids this. A
  `pyproject.toml` whose only mypy content is `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` tables is still mypy's
  config, since mypy passes over a shared file only when it has no `tool.mypy` key; a reader that
  matches `[name]` headers with a single-bracket pattern misreads `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` and
  reports no config, and a rendered `mypy.ini` then hides the project's overrides: the project's own
  `mypy` passed while the floor's gate failed on the one module the override told mypy to skip. A
  `[[tool.mypy]]` array where mypy expects a table stops mypy with `TypeError: str object expected;
  got dict`, and `mypy --config-file=` with an empty value runs with no config, which shows what a
  config is hiding (A, mypy 2.3.1) [as-of 2026-09-25]. ruff reads `ruff.toml` and `pyproject.toml`
  `[tool.ruff]`; a dotted key (`tool.ruff.line-length = 88`) or an inline table declares the section
  as much as a table header. shellcheck reads a project's `.shellcheckrc`; a `shellcheckrc` without
  the dot is read only under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. The search that held goes through the component root and then each parent up
  to the repository root, nearest first, stopping at the first directory holding one of the tool's
  configs. When one component's root sits below another's, each path goes to the nearest component
  only; otherwise the outer component also lints the nested root, where its `tests/**`
  per-file-ignore misses the nested tests, and a changed path under both roots runs both. Each
  nested root is then excluded from the outer component's run (A, a layout with nested component roots).
- Which test runner a project declares (L, read 2026-10-01; [pytest
  configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/customize.html), [GNU make makefile
  names](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html),
  [just](https://just.systems/man/en/quick-start.html), [tox
  configuration](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/reference/config.html)). pytest looks for `pytest.toml`,
  `.pytest.toml` (from 9.0), `pytest.ini`, `.pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pytest]`
  (9.0) or `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, `tox.ini` with `[pytest]` and `setup.cfg` with
  `[tool:pytest]`; by convention a `pytest` requirement or a `conftest.py` at the root or in
  `tests/` also declares it, while a plugin requirement such as `pytest-cov` alone declares nothing.
  tox reads `tox.ini`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml` under `tool.tox` (natively or through a
  `legacy_tox_ini` key) and `tox.toml`, its INI forms now deprecated. GNU make tries `GNUmakefile`,
  `makefile` and `Makefile` in that order, and `.PHONY: test` is not a `test` target. just finds
  `justfile` in any capitalisation, or `.justfile`, searching upward. `go test ./...` runs where
  `go.mod` is, not at a `go.work` root with no module, and a workspace member's lockfile sits in the
  nearest enclosing directory that holds one. A detector that offered `python3 -m unittest` to a
  project declaring pytest in `pyproject.toml`, with a `conftest.py` and a `make test` target,
  proposed a command the project does not run (A).
- mypy layout traps: a same-named module under two directories aborted mypy with `Duplicate module
  named …`, outside the JSON parser's statuses (excluding the duplicate tree fixed it;
  `explicit_package_bases` with `namespace_packages` makes them two modules); with `files = src` and
  explicit package bases but no `mypy_path = src`, `src/pkg/x.py` was read as both `src.pkg.x` and
  `pkg.x`. mypy's `exclude` is a regex, and an empty alternation matches everything, so `(?!)` is the pattern for nothing excluded. `python3 -m mypy` needs mypy importable by that exact interpreter; a
  `uv tool install mypy` satisfies neither the check nor its version probe; an isolated `uvx mypy` can
  lack the project's dependencies and plugins.
- Exclusion syntax differs per tool: comma-joined globs for vulture and phpmd; regexes for deptry,
  mypy and deptrac; arrays for ruff, tsconfig, PHPStan `excludePaths` and php-cs-fixer;
  `**/<tree>/**` globs for ESLint `ignores`; regex lists for the gitleaks allowlist and golangci
  `exclusions.paths`; gitignore syntax for prettier's ignore file (and `--ignore-path` replaces
  prettier's defaults, so the project's own ignores must be named again); no flag at all for shfmt
  and gofumpt. Exclusion names apply to paths relative to the component root: matching absolute path
  parts made any component under a directory named `build`, `vendor` or `dist` measure zero files.
  gitignore matching has to honour parents, `*`, `**` and `!` negations; exact-string matching
  produced false FAILs. Compared with `git check-ignore` over 46 rule shapes, a translation of `*`
  to one path segment and `**` to any depth at segment boundaries agreed with Git on 14 of 15
  designed cases; Git's `x/**` matches everything under `x` but not `x` itself, and a `**` away from
  a segment boundary matches within one segment only (A) [as-of 2026-09-23]. A matcher that leaves
  out `?`, `[...]`, negations or a slash-free rule's match at any depth has to say so where it is
  used.
- A rendered config that does not exclude the floor's own installed directory makes the fitting
  arrive as a lint diff, and a tool's config belongs in the project only when a selected claim runs
  that tool (inference).
- A tool binary tracked in the repository is code the change under review controls. A floor meant to
  hold against that change runs its tools from outside the checkout or from an environment built from
  locked dependencies, not from a directory the change can edit.

## 5. Detecting a loosening (Q6)

**What counts.** The worst grade wins (unclassified, then loosening, then tightening, then none):

| Change | Grade |
| --- | --- |
| A component removed, or its root narrowed | loosening |
| A tool version changed, or the same version with a different identity probe | loosening |
| A tool substituted for a claim | loosening |
| A claim removed; a mode moved toward observe; a selection entry removed | loosening |
| A threshold moved against its declared direction | loosening; unknown direction or a non-integer value is unclassified |
| An exemption added, or its reassess-by date extended | loosening |
| A baseline occurrence added | loosening |
| A tool config changed, or a suppression comment added (`noqa`, `type: ignore`, `shellcheck disable`), or a `.gitleaksignore` entry added | loosening |
| A policy file removed; the acceptance log rewritten or truncated | loosening |
| A plan path or a baseline's bound path changed; a parameter changed; any other policy file changed | unclassified, treated as loosening |
| A claim added; a mode moved toward gate; a baseline entry removed; an exemption narrowed | tightening |

**Ways a comparison lets a loosening through**, each observed in probes of one implementation (A):

- Comparing only part of the policy: pointing the check plan at a new plan that ran `/usr/bin/true`
  graded "tightening"; a fabricated identity probe (`python3 -c 'print("ruff 0.16.7")'`) passed as
  "none"; declaring a fast selection over an implicit default graded "tightening". Comparing the
  whole effective policy (plan paths, baseline bindings, identity probes and effective selections)
  closed these.
- Reading the base's policy from the candidate's file list let the candidate drop its profile from
  the list and be compared against nothing; reading the base's policy at its own path and comparing the
  union of both lists closed this; the policy file is identified by path, not by JSON shape: a
  weakened tsconfig carrying the profile's keys escaped comparison.
- Rendering only the candidate graded restoring a generated default (`max-complexity = 10`) over an
  accepted stricter value (`5`) as "none"; rendering both sides closed this. A value several claims share (an
  exclusion list) must be classified as the combined effective value.
- A change whose displayed before and after were equal (one baseline identity swapped for another)
  was covered by an unrelated acceptance; the display has to be injective (`["a,b"]` and `["a","b"]`
  joined with commas looked the same), and acceptances scoped by component.
- Chains of step acceptances (4 to 5, 5 to 6) can accept a squashed range (4 to 6); timestamps compare
  as instants (`…T23:00:00+05:00` is earlier than `…T20:00:00Z` the same day).
- Grading a configuration revision by its number made every revision move a loosening, including
  moves whose only change was a rendering at the same description. A move is graded by rendering the
  installed profile under the old and the new revision and comparing the effective policy; the old
  revision is read from Git at the base or from a released tag, not from bytes the diff under review
  could have written; an unreadable old side caps the result at UNVERIFIED.
- A fresh fitting record laundered baseline growth: a floor recorded without a fitting record
  (strict mode writes empty baselines) could be refitted with new findings recorded and read "no
  loosening". Only a claim whose baseline file was absent at the base, not one that was empty, is
  exempt from the loosening check.
- Pinning a check's definition does not pin what it runs: with the definition unchanged, the script
  it invoked was edited from exit 1 to exit 0 and the run reported PASS under the trusted
  definition (O). Pinning each declared input the outcome depends on (the script, an
  imported checker module, the checker's configuration) and verifying those pins before the run and
  after every command closes the gap; a claim that declares no inputs reports its trust as UNVERIFIED and never
  reaches a trusted PASS, and files found among its arguments are a diagnostic, never proof that
  the declaration is complete. A hook that refuses any staged change to its own configuration
  refuses the commit that installs it, leaving `--no-verify` as the only way through; letting the
  caller supply an accepted pin for the staged file instead avoids that (O).

**Acknowledging a loosening.** In the implementation probed, a loosening passed when a commit in the
range carried a trailer naming what was loosened and who decided, and a search of the log for that
trailer was the ledger. This makes a loosening visible; it cannot
prevent one, since the same agent can edit the check. An acceptance log inside the agent's writable
tree gives cooperative detection, not enforcement.

**Enforcement.** Prevention needs a gate the project controls that obtains the accepted policy
independently of the candidate: branch protection with required review over the policy paths, set
outside the repository. A `CODEOWNERS` line counts only when branch protection requires code-owner
review, and only after it is read back with no later matching rule below it (a later rule wins). On
a private repository on GitHub's free plan the branch-protection API answers 403 ("Upgrade to GitHub
Pro or make this repository public"), so there it guards nothing (L) [as-of 2026-09-28]. Each
`CODEOWNERS` line is one file pattern followed by its owners, so a line naming two paths reads the
second as an owner and protects only the first: one pattern per line is needed, with a space
inside a path escaped (L, GitHub's "About code owners" and GitLab's Code Owners syntax, read 2026-10-01; not
tested against either service). A floor run only from a Git `pre-commit` hook is skipped by `git
commit --no-verify`, which bypasses the `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks (L,
[githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), read 2026-10-01): a hook shortens feedback, and only
a check the project controls outside the agent's reach, such as a required CI job, holds a boundary.

**The base ref in CI** (L, A):

- On a pull request the base is `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` (GitHub) or
  `origin/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME` (GitLab), passed through `env:` and never interpolated
  into the shell.
- On a push the base is `github.event.before` or `$CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA` when it is not the
  all-zero id of a new ref and `git rev-parse --verify --quiet` resolves it, else `HEAD~1`; a
  multi-commit push is one policy diff, not its tip against `HEAD~1`; a tag is a new ref, so its
  base is `HEAD~1`. A push step gated on the default-branch ref, not only on the event, avoids running on
  feature branches where `HEAD~1` is not the base.
- Default clones are shallow on GitHub and GitLab, so the base does not resolve and the check reads
  UNVERIFIED on every pull request while looking wired; `fetch-depth: 0`, `GIT_DEPTH: 0` or a fetch of the target branch
  fixes it. An unset CI variable passed as an empty base produced a green run that
  compared nothing.
- On GitLab a job's `rules` decide which pipelines it joins: a job with none defaults to `except:
  merge_requests`, so it runs in branch pipelines, feature-branch pushes included, but not in
  merge request pipelines; a rule `if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"` is what makes a
  project run merge request pipelines at all, and mixing the two without `workflow:rules` runs
  duplicate pipelines (L, [GitLab merge request
  pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines/), read 2026-10-01; A
  [as-of 2026-09-25]).
- The base resolves with `git rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}` and then `git merge-base <ref>
  HEAD`. Only Git's own "does not exist in" and "exists on disk, but not in" messages can mean a
  file is absent at the ref; a damaged object, a missing pack or a permission error is a refusal, not
  an absence. The second message also answers for a path under a directory that is a symlink at
  the ref, so a reader that maps it to "absent" reads a policy file behind a link as no policy (git
  2.55.0) [as-of 2026-09-23]. Under a localized Git those messages change, so the locale is pinned for Git
  subprocesses. For a symlink, `git show <ref>:<path>` returns the link target as the blob, and for
  a directory `git show <ref>:<dir>` exits 0 and prints a tree listing (`tree <ref>:<dir>`, a blank
  line, the entries) as if it were the file's bytes. `<ref>:<path>` resolves from the repository's
  top whatever the working directory (`<ref>:./<path>` is relative to it), so a tool run from a
  subdirectory reads another file or none. A path reads safely by walking its prefixes with `git
  ls-tree -z <ref> -- <prefix>`, one prefix a call (given several paths, `ls-tree` lists a named
  directory's children rather than its own entry), with `--full-tree` when run below the top: each
  call prints one record, `<mode> <type> <object>`, a tab and the path, or nothing with exit 0 where
  the path is absent; mode `120000` is a symlink, `040000 tree` a directory, a `commit` entry a
  submodule, and `100644` or `100755 blob` a file (A, git 2.55.0) [as-of 2026-09-23]. In Python,
  `Path.is_symlink()` tests only the last component, so a glob match reached through a symlinked
  parent passes a leaf check, so every ancestor needs testing (A). `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` honours
  `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` and `core.worktree`: set to a sibling repository, they made Git name a
  top outside the target, and computing paths relative to it failed; the remedy was to require the top to be the
  target or one of its ancestors and to unset those variables for Git subprocesses (A)
  [as-of 2026-09-24].
  Changed paths expand with `git diff --name-only -z --no-ext-diff --no-textconv
  --ignore-submodules=all --no-renames <base>...HEAD`, read NUL-delimited, with
  `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS` and `GIT_PAGER` stripped from the environment.
- The base's policy is read by its path from the repository root, so a floor installed for a
  directory below the top of the repository cannot be compared with its base unless its files are
  named from the root; the options are to install it at the root with that directory as a
  component, or to run without a base comparison and say so.

## 6. Fitting an existing project, and secrets (Q7, Q14)

**Record when fitted, gate each change.** In the implementation probed, fitting a floor to a
project that already had findings recorded every existing finding per claim, with the fitting commit and date;
afterwards a claim failed only on findings beyond its record. Secrets were never recorded: each one
found was listed once for triage, to be rotated or allowlisted by its fingerprint in
`.gitleaksignore`, and a change to that file was itself a loosening. Without a base, the secrets
claim scanned only commits since the fitting; the fitting commit has to be an ancestor (`git
merge-base --is-ancestor`), since after a rebase a range from it spans the rewritten history. A
shallow clone without the fitting commit read UNVERIFIED. A tool missing when the floor was fitted
left its claim UNVERIFIED until provisioned; dropping it silently would hide, for example, the only
secrets check from CI and reviewers. When a tool could not settle at fitting (mypy stopping on a
duplicate module name), the claim was left out with the file named. On a scratch project with one
finding per claim, the first check after fitting read PASS on format and secrets, FAIL on lint for
the one new finding, and PASS on the loosening check.

A check that writes evidence inside the project leaves it as untracked files in every later status
unless that directory is ignored (O).

**Secret scanners.** gitleaks can scan a commit range (`gitleaks git --log-opts=<base>..HEAD
--redact`) or a directory (`gitleaks dir`; the older `detect` and `protect` commands, `detect
--no-git` among them, were deprecated in v8.19.0 and are hidden from `--help`; L, [gitleaks
README](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks), read 2026-10-01). A directory scan is the wrong
gate for a change: it misses a secret added and removed within one push, reads untracked local
files such as `.env`, and inherits whatever the floor excludes; the commit-range scan with
gitleaks' own allowlist covers what the change committed (A, gitleaks 8.21.2 options)
[as-of 2026-09-28]. On gitleaks 8.30.1 a `.gitleaksignore` fingerprint of the form
`path:rule:line` (for example `cfg.py:generic-api-key:1`) allowlisted the finding in both modes. A
configuration with `[extend] useDefault = true` keeps the default rules; an `[allowlist] paths` entry
is a tree the scan does not read, never a secret it forgives. gitleaks and osv-scanner have no npm or
uv wrapper (`npx --yes gitleaks`: "could not determine executable to run"; `npx --yes osv-scanner`:
404). (L, A)

**Redaction.** A secret scanner's evidence can leak the secret through counts that print matching
lines, verbatim execution logs, parser notes and exception text quoting input. The practice that held was
to redact every string a security parser emits (messages become `<redacted>`, notes are replaced,
exception text dropped), keep security logs to the redacted findings list, keep the anchor (or
identities change), and never let the message decide identity, since it can carry the secret. Fully redacted failure notes leave nothing to
diagnose from, and widening them risks leaking a prefix of scanned text. Connection strings and tokens come from the
operator's environment, never from committed policy (Atlas reads `ATLAS_URL` and `ATLAS_TOKEN`). `npm audit` transmits the project's dependency inventory; `osv-scanner --offline`
against a recorded database snapshot does not, and a snapshot's identity, not only its date, should be
recorded. `shell=False` does not sandbox a tool's configuration, plugins or build scripts. (A, L)

## 7. Runs that establish nothing (Q8)

**Vacuous passes observed** (A, L):

- `ruff check --no-cache --isolated --exclude '*.py' --output-format json .` exits 0 with `[]` over a
  tree of 206 Python files; ruff's JSON is a bare list with no file count, so an empty list reads the
  same whether ruff read everything or nothing.
- import-linter with no contracts exits 0 with `Contracts: 0 kept, 0 broken.`
- A bats entry-point list that matched nothing rendered an empty loop that reported PASS.
- shellcheck on a nonexistent file prints an error, then `[]`, with a non-zero exit.
- knip JSON of the wrong shape (`{"Issues": []}`) read as clean unless the `issues` key is required.
- cargo's `{"reason":"build-finished","success":false}` with `error: failed to run custom build
  command` (exit 101) was read as clean; so was a cargo test binary's `ok` summary followed by `error:
  doctest failed`.
- A Go package that fails with no failing test (a `TestMain` or teardown failure); PHPStan's
  top-level `errors` string (`Internal error: …`); govulncheck findings without `fixed_version`; a
  coverage converter that wrote an empty LCOV and exited 0 on unreadable input; a SQL statement
  scanner whose masking order let an apostrophe in a comment hide the next `DROP TABLE`.
- `bash -n a.sh b.sh` parses only its first operand; `find … -exec bash -n {} ;` exits 0 whatever the
  scripts do, so the diagnostics text must become the finding.
- pytest writes JUnit to the `--junitxml` path and a human summary on stdout; parsing stdout as JUnit
  read a passing suite as UNVERIFIED. A skipped test inside an exit-0 JUnit report is a finding, not a
  pass.
- A script that reads `--help` as an ordinary argument: one checked a directory named `--help`,
  found no file, printed `OK` and exited 0; another opened `--help` as its input path and raised. A
  check that every entry point "answers `--help`" passes the first; an argument parser in
  each script that answers `-h` and `--help` itself avoids this.

**Wrong-direction failures observed:** diff-cover's trailing `Failure. Coverage is below 90%.` after
its JSON made a below-threshold run read UNVERIFIED instead of FAIL; making every uncovered file a
finding made a 90% threshold behave as 100%; exact-string gitignore matching produced false FAILs.

**Reading output safely.** Merging stderr into stdout puts deprecation warnings, resolver lines and
banners in front of a JSON document: the working practice reads from the first line that opens one and keeps the prefix as a
note, scanning from line starts, since a brace inside a warning is not a document. Five tool families exit
non-zero for reasons unrelated to findings, so each parser declares which exit statuses mean the tool
completed, and completion keys on something the tool printed. Tolerance stops where it would turn a failure
into a clean tree: a prefix plus an empty report plus a non-zero exit is "not completed". "No
document found" differs from "a document of the wrong shape". A declared output file that is absent or
unreadable is "not supplied", not a clean read; deptry writes no JSON file at all when it fails before
analysis. Analysis scripts that always print a final completion line (`… files=<n>`) and exit 0
whether or not they find anything let one that died read UNVERIFIED. Parsers that are pure (no
filesystem, clock or network), with an exception becoming "not completed" and only its type in the
note, fit the same design.

**Verdict precedence** that avoids a false PASS, first match wins: tool identity not established;
timed out, executable or input missing, or parser not completed; zero files measured; exit status
outside the parser's completion statuses; baseline absent — each UNVERIFIED; then gate (any finding
not exempt fails), baseline (any occurrence beyond the record fails) or observe (report only). A
measured-file count is the runner's estimate, not the tool's own selection: label it measured or
reported. An all-observe plan runs and reports UNVERIFIED with its observations, never PASS; CI can
tolerate that with ` || [ $? -eq 2 ]`. What runs stays apart from what gates: running every claim on
every invocation ran monthly mutation checks each time, so periodic claims go in their own plan.
Two recipes rendering the identical command keep one copy at the strongest mode and report the
dropped one; a selection naming a dropped claim is noted as running nothing.

## 8. Pinning and provisioning (Q9) (VOLATILE)

- A claim needs its tool present at or above a minimum version; a missing tool makes the claim
  UNVERIFIED, and a gating UNVERIFIED fails the check by name. Exact pins turn claims UNVERIFIED on
  patch drift; interpreters and shells pinned at major.minor and matched by prefix (`3.14` admits
  `3.14.7` and refuses `3.140.1`) avoid it. Versions match component-wise, not by substring.
  clippy and rustfmt carry version numbers distinct from cargo's; vulture and import-linter print
  two-component versions (`vulture 2.16`) that bare-semver readers cannot parse; goimports
  publishes no version at all.
- The probe has to use the executable that will run, under the claim's exact path: with project-local directories
  (`.venv/bin`, `node_modules/.bin`, `vendor/bin`) first on the path, the probe found
  `.venv/bin/shfmt` while the claim ran another shfmt. A version probe never provisions, and
  discovery never runs programs found on a path the target controls.
- In the implementation probed, a package script was offered as a check candidate only by name from an allowlist (`test`, `test:*`,
  `lint`, `lint:*`, `typecheck`, `check`, `verify`, `format:check`): `dev`, `start`, `serve` and
  `watch` offered as tests hang when run, and a fixture's script named `test` ran a deployment, so
  a name is never evidence of what a command does. Each candidate was labelled an observed command
  with unverified effects, and none ran until a person had read and confirmed its exact command
  (O).
- A passing local gate does not say how hosted CI obtains its tools: a reference workflow copied
  with its placeholder repository (`your-org/…`) left that unresolved while the local gate passed
  (A). Where CI gets each tool, at which pinned version, is a question to settle before wiring the line; a
  local run and a hosted run are separate evidence.
- Provisioning is a separate, consented, network-enabled step in the design that held: each command
  is printed first, the step stops at the first failure, succeeds only when a re-probe passes, and
  provisions into the environment the checks run (`python3 -m pip` under the component's path, not a bare `pip` that installed elsewhere). `uvx
  --offline ruff@<v>` resolves only after a prior `uv tool install`, which lands in `~/.local/bin`,
  a path a project whose `.venv` carries its own ruff never runs; `uv add --dev ruff==<pin>` touches
  `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` instead. `uvx` and `npx --yes` both install into caches, and a
  direct version pin does not freeze a tool's own dependency tree. `go run <module>@<version>` (the
  module cache), `cargo install --root <dir>` and a downloaded `composer.phar` were the cache-only
  routes used to capture fixtures without a system install (A) [as-of 2026-09-14]; each fetches on
  first use, as `go tool` does for a tool tracked by the `tool` directive Go 1.24 added to `go.mod`
  (the directive: L, [Go 1.24 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.24), read 2026-10-01), so each
  is a provisioning act and never a check-time path. ESLint with plugins, PHP tools and cargo
  subcommands need a real installation. An environment made by `uv tool install` held no pip
  (`python -m pip` failed with `No module named pip`), and only the tool's own command is linked
  onto `PATH`, so a tool that provisions with `sys.executable -m pip` fails there, and would install
  where checks never look if it worked (A, uv 0.11.6) [as-of 2026-10-01]; pipx's documentation says
  its pip backend lends each environment one shared pip through a `.pth` file, while its uv backend
  builds environments without pip (L, [how pipx
  works](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/explanation/how-pipx-works.html), read 2026-10-01). Provisioning
  into the interpreter the project's checks run, found on `PATH`, is what works. `npm install --save-dev` puts
  tools under `node_modules/.bin`, which is not on the path. `shfmt-py==3.14.1` does not exist on
  PyPI; `shfmt-py==4.2.0` ships shfmt 3.14.1.
- Offline switches for a check environment: `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`, `COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK=1`,
  `GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly`, `GOPROXY=off`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, `PIP_NO_INDEX=1`, `UV_OFFLINE=1`,
  `npm_config_offline=true`; and `GOWORK=off`, which keeps a Go check to its own module when a
  `go.work` workspace sits above it ("If `GOWORK` is set to `off`, the command will be in a
  single-module context"; L, [Go modules reference](https://go.dev/ref/mod), read 2026-10-01). Under
  `-mod=mod`, `go vet` and `go test` added a `go` line to `go.mod` and wrote `go.sum`; cargo without
  `--locked` created `Cargo.lock`. With the read-only switches nothing is written: under
  `-mod=readonly` a module missing `go.sum` entries makes `go vet`, `go test` and `go list -deps`
  exit 1 ("missing go.sum entry"), and `cargo check`, `clippy` and `test` with `--locked` and no
  `Cargo.lock` exit 101; with a current lock they leave it byte-identical (A, go 1.27.1, cargo
  1.98.1) [as-of 2026-09-25]. Such a refusal reads as UNVERIFIED, not as a finding. With `GOFLAGS`
  unset, go acts as if `-mod=vendor` were given in a module whose `go.mod` says 1.14 or later and
  that has a `vendor` directory; golangci-lint loads packages through `go list` and is exposed the
  same way; `--frozen` is `--locked` plus `--offline` (L, the Go modules reference and Cargo's
  command documentation, read 2026-10-01). A `toolchain` line with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` does not
  enforce exact equality. `FOO=` and an unset `FOO` behave differently in enough tools that a plan
  must say which it means. Network locations are refused in check parameters: govulncheck
  against its network database printed 14,493 lines, and a `-db https://…` value sends a request
  from inside a check. No offline switch stops govulncheck: `GOPROXY=off` governs the go command's
  module downloads, while govulncheck v1.1.4 hands an `http` or `https` `-db` to Go's standard HTTP
  client and a `file` URL to a local reader, refusing other schemes (L, govulncheck v1.1.4 source,
  read 2026-10-01); it made a `HEAD /index/modules.json.gz` request to a local server with every
  offline marker set, and a govulncheck built from source reports `v0.0.0`, which a version gate
  refuses (A) [as-of 2026-09-25].
- A syntax check through `python -m compileall` needs `-f`: without it, compileall skips a source
  whose cached bytecode records the same modification time (the source compares a header of magic
  number, flags and timestamp), and a run without `-f` accepted stale bytecode (O [as-of
  2026-09-09]; L, [compileall](https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html) and its source,
  read 2026-10-01). An intentionally invalid fixture can be excluded with `-x <regex>` and a recorded reason
  rather than dropping the check. A pass establishes syntax for that interpreter only: not imports,
  tests or runtime behaviour.
- Volatile values (observation times, install timestamps, run directories) stay out of pinned
  policy, and "today" comes from the caller rather than from a clock inside the library.

## 9. Parser fixtures (Q10)

- Every fixture (clean, findings, failure) is captured from the pinned tool, with the command and
  version recorded; capture-directory absolute paths are replaced with component-relative ones and
  nothing else is edited; a recipe stays "candidate" until every parser it names is captured. In one floor, fixtures
  were captured for ruff, mypy, vulture, deptry, import-linter, mutmut, shellcheck, shfmt, bash,
  bats, pytest, pytest-cov, rustfmt, clippy, cargo check, cargo test, gofumpt, go vet, go test and
  `go mod tidy -diff`; hand-written for gitleaks, osv-scanner, diff-cover, the generic JUnit and
  LCOV readers, golangci-lint, govulncheck, cargo-machete, cargo-deny and every TypeScript, PHP and
  SQL parser. At an earlier count, 8 of the 27 parsers of its five candidate stacks (Rust, Go,
  TypeScript, PHP and SQL) were captured; Q10 gives the later count by claim. Facts resting on
  hand-written fixtures are UNVERIFIED on the tool.
- 144 passing fixture comparisons established consistency with the fixtures, not native-tool
  correctness; qualifying a stack also needs a composed journey with injected defects, a
  baseline-gaming attempt, a missing-tool run, an upgrade and a reversal. Sample projects clean by
  construction never exercise a real finding; findings fixtures belong in separate scratch projects.
- Mutation controls: a limit mutation has to cross the fixture's value (63 to 64 did not bite on a
  66-byte identifier; 63 to 67 did); a bytes-versus-characters control pairs with it; a revert comes
  from a copy, since `git checkout <file>` drops uncommitted edits; a stale `__pycache__` with the same size and mtime
  second served the mutated module; a hand edit to generated JSON is lost at the next regeneration.
- Python traps in count checks: `bool` subclasses `int`, so `isinstance(True, int) and True > 0`
  admits `files: True`; a `$`-anchored regex with `re.match` admits a trailing newline, so `\Z` is the fix.

## 10. What a floor costs (Q11–Q13)

- The audited floor: 25 modules and about 15,800 lines, about 18,200 test lines, 7,300 template
  lines, 5,900 spec lines and 45 fixture trees. What reached CI and mattered was three claims in
  about 11 s, roughly `ruff format --check`, `ruff check` and `mypy`, each with a baseline filter. A
  smaller design of about 1,000–1,500 lines (each claim as argv, output format and mode; a plain-text
  baseline; gate and baseline modes; a minimum-version check) delivers the same. (M)
- Debt on the audited repository when the floor was fitted (M): fitted by
  hand, `ruff format` would have rewritten 118 of 142 Python files, and 1,286 lint findings sat
  behind 117 `[lint.per-file-ignores]` lines covering 459 file-and-rule pairs, so the gate held
  new files, not new lines. Fitted through the floor's own tooling, the format gate reported 116 files once the
  immutable trees were excluded (128 with them); the tree was reformatted once, in its own
  mechanical commit, and `ruff format --check` then gated 276 files. The first content-anchored
  baselines held 528 lint identities over 1,133 occurrences and 1,289 type identities over 6,865.
  An import-cycle check run once by hand found one real cycle between two core modules; it was
  never gated, so nothing kept it from returning. Lint and type counts elsewhere in this reference
  differ by date and configuration (1,286 by hand, 1,133 occurrences, 1,078 at the later audit;
  6,865 and then 6,945 type findings).
- Line ceilings (Q11): a module split to go under 900 lines regrew to 946 fourteen minutes later with
  nothing flagging it; the audited floor's own modules sat at 900, 899 and 889 lines. (M)
- The audited floor's `tests` claim duplicated the project's own test command, and the suite
  asserted the format claim a second time; running the whole test suite inside a quick check target
  is expensive, so tests, coverage and structure stay out of a fast selection, and each claim's
  duration is recorded.
- Tests that only prove matrix coverage (that a table cell exists) can pass for commands that do not
  exist.

Per-tool facts beyond those above (L, A):

- **ruff 0.16.7** formats Python code blocks inside Markdown; it rewrote a spec's sketches into 73
  expanded lines, so documents whose exact bytes matter need excluding. `ruff format --check` exits
  2 when a file cannot be parsed, and its first output line still reads `unformatted: File would be
  reformatted`; the `error: Failed to parse <file>` line comes later, so on exit 2 the first
  line that starts with `error` is the report (A, ruff 0.16) [as-of 2026-09-29]. Its documentation gives 2 for an
  abnormal end "due to invalid configuration, invalid CLI options, or an internal error" and names
  no parse failure (L, [ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/), read 2026-10-01).
- **vulture 2.16** prints records of the shape `path:line: message (N% confidence)` for more than
  unused names: `unreachable code after …` and `unsatisfiable … condition` too. One existing
  project's report carried `unsatisfiable 'ternary' condition`, which a reader expecting only
  `unused …` refused, failing the claim; `vulture .` walks a project's `.venv` unless `--exclude`
  names it (A) [as-of 2026-09-17].
- **osv-scanner 2.x**: the source scan is `osv-scanner scan source --offline --format json
  --output-file <path> .` (`--output` still works but is deprecated); it finds the lockfiles, SBOMs
  and Git directories in the target directory, and searches subdirectories only with `-r` or
  `--recursive`, so a scan of the root reads only the root's lockfiles (L, [osv-scanner
  usage](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/usage/scan-source) and its flag source, read
  2026-10-01; never run here).
- **pytest** leaves no `__pycache__` or `.pytest_cache` with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `-p
  no:cacheprovider`; `pytest --version` identifies pytest, not the pytest-cov plugin; parsing JUnit
  with `xml.etree` resolves no external entity but does not stop an internal-entity expansion.
- **diff-cover**: `--format json:- -q` prints the JSON report on stdout; `--json-report <path>`
  writes a file; useful fields are `total_num_lines` and `total_percent_covered`. A diff-coverage
  percentage does not prove every changed executable file was in the report: deleting tests or
  changing inclusion shrinks the denominator, so the resolved merge-base and the measured
  file set need recording. A coverage claim with no resolvable base, or whose test run did not happen, is
  UNVERIFIED.
- **Coverage formats**: vitest, pytest-cov and cargo-llvm-cov write LCOV; PHPUnit writes Clover and
  `go test -coverprofile` its own format, so both need a converter; `gocov convert` emits gocov
  JSON, not LCOV; `go test -coverprofile=<dir>/cover.out` fails when `<dir>` does not exist; LCOV's
  file count is its `SF:` records.
- **cargo** writes non-JSON progress on stderr and reports one diagnostic once per compiled target
  (lib and lib test), so collapse duplicates; clippy exits 101 on a finding and on a missing manifest,
  so key completion on `{"reason":"build-finished"}`; on stable, `cargo test --message-format json`
  covers the build, not test outcomes, so read one `test result:` line per test binary; cargo-deny
  prints concatenated JSON values (`json.loads` fails with "extra data"), completing on its `summary`
  record.
- **Go**: golangci-lint caps how many issues it prints per linter and how many identical issues
  (`issues.max-issues-per-linter`, default 50; `issues.max-same-issues`, default 3; "Set to 0 to
  disable"), so a floor that baselines its findings sets both to 0, or a capped report reads as the
  whole (L, [golangci-lint configuration](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/configuration/file/), read
  2026-10-01). A v2 configuration used as a Go floor (A, never run clean):
  `version: "2"`; `linters.default: standard` (the default) plus `bodyclose`, `errorlint`, `funlen`
  (60 lines, 50 statements), `gocognit` (15), `gocyclo` (10), `gosec`, `nilerr`, `noctx`, `revive`
  and `unconvert`; and `formatters: gci, gofumpt` in place of goimports, the formatters having moved
  to their own section in v2; one run then serves complexity, dead code (`unused`) and security
  (`gosec`). golangci-lint prints a human summary after its JSON; golangci-lint 2.6.1 could not read
  go 1.27 export data, so every issue came out as `typecheck`; gofumpt skips `vendor`, `testdata`
  and `go.mod` ignore directives; `go mod tidy -diff` exits 0 or prints `diff <a> <b>` headers, and
  a non-zero exit with no header means it refused to run; depguard and Go's compiler-enforced
  `internal/` rule cover import direction.
- **Shell**: shellcheck expands no globs and runs no shell, so literal paths are needed; it reports an
  unused variable (SC2034), and clean quoting diagnostics do not prove the absence of injection;
  shfmt skips only version-control directories and has no exclusion flag (run it through `find …
  -prune -o … -exec shfmt -d {} +`); `bash -n` cannot parse bats (`@test "x" { … }` fails with exit
  2); bats has no coverage reporter. Each shell entry needs quoting (`shlex.quote`): a double-quoted
  `scripts/$(printf EXPANDED).sh` is executed. Running a script with `--help` to learn whether it is
  harmless is itself execution, so the safe set is the entry points the project declares, expanded to literal
  paths when the check is written and never globbed at run time, with no library executed (no
  executable bit, or a `# library` marker in its first five lines). A rule set that demands `set
  -euo pipefail` or a working `--help` from every script rejects sourced libraries and non-CLI
  scripts. The shellcheck codes closest to injection are SC2086 (unquoted expansion), SC2046
  (unquoted command substitution) and SC2091 (executing a substitution's output) (A, L, a design
  review and the as-built recipe).
- **SQL**: sqlfluff `format` applies fixes and `fix --check` asks before applying, so neither is a
  check; sqlfluff honours only `.sqlfluffignore`. A statement scanner must mask `--`, `/* */`, `'…'`
  (with `''` escapes) and `$tag$…$tag$` in one left-to-right pass, preserving line numbers, must not
  mask `"…"` identifiers (which would hide `DROP TABLE "orders"`), and must split on `;` only after
  masking; a quoted `;` in an identifier (`ALTER TABLE "t;u" DROP COLUMN x;`) still splits wrongly.
  The presence of `$jsonSchema` in a MongoDB migration does not show the validator is installed or
  enforced. Atlas `migrate lint` needs a development database and, from v0.38, a paid plan and
  authentication.
- **Package managers**: `uv sync` and `npm ci` are not read-only (`npm ci` removes an existing
  `node_modules`); `npm ci --dry-run` is not a lock-consistency check; frozen resolution is weaker
  than a reproducible artifact. Lockfile to manager: `uv.lock` uv, `package-lock.json` npm,
  `composer.lock` Composer, `Cargo.lock` cargo, `go.sum` go. A `uv.lock` written in a project with
  no `[project]` table locks nothing: it declared `requires-python = ">=3.13"`, `uv lock --check`
  failed with "No `project` table found", and `uv sync` warned and built a bare 3.13 environment (A,
  uv 0.11.6 [as-of 2026-10-01]; uv's documentation, read the same day, names no behaviour for that
  case).
  `uv lock --check` is the lockfile counterpart of `--locked` for other commands (L).
- **Mutation testing** (periodic, never gated): mutmut (Python), Stryker (TypeScript), Infection
  (PHP), cargo-mutants (Rust), gremlins (Go); none for shell.
- **Not covered by the checks above**: a shell function no script calls (a wrong answer deletes
  code), and orphaned or wrongly layered data models, which need the project's own model graph and
  naming conventions.

## What the evidence supports (inference)

These points are this reference's reading of the findings above. They are not orders.

1. Claims chosen by defect class fit the audit: format (gate), lint with a rule set tuned to real
   bug classes (baseline, then gate), types in basic mode with `check_untyped_defs` (baseline),
   secrets (gate at zero), shell syntax and injection (gate). Line ceilings, observe-only claims and
   claims whose tools nobody will install added cost without catching anything (Q2, Q3, Q11, Q12).
2. Each tool ran with the project's own configuration from the project root; where the project had
   none, the audit added one as an ordinary project file (Q5).
3. Existing findings recorded when the floor was fitted, in plain-text baselines keyed
   `path:rule:message` and counted as a multiset, with secrets triaged instead of recorded (Q4,
   Q7).
4. Each change gated against the base read from Git: new findings fail, and so does any loosening
   not acknowledged in a commit trailer; CI fetches full history (Q6).
5. A run that measured nothing, timed out, or exited unexpectedly reads as UNVERIFIED, and a gating
   UNVERIFIED fails (Q8).
6. Tools required at a minimum version, with a missing one visible as UNVERIFIED (Q9).
7. Every parser fixture captured from the real tool (Q10).
8. The floor's files protected by required review on the host where the plan allows it; where it
   does not, the check is visible but not enforced (Q6).
9. Agents fix or suppress inline with a reason, never grow a baseline, and tighten freely.
10. Every input a check runs (script, checker module, configuration), not only its definition,
    pinned and verified, and what Git tracks walked rather than the filesystem when a check
    executes scripts (Q15, §1).

## Limits and open questions

- The measurements come from one audited floor over 11 days; no
  controlled comparison shows a floor changes defect rates or what agents write.
- Much tool behaviour for TypeScript, PHP, SQL, gitleaks, osv-scanner, diff-cover, golangci-lint and
  govulncheck rests on documentation and hand-written fixtures, and is UNVERIFIED on the tools.
- Whether commit-trailer acknowledgement changes behaviour, and how often agents try to loosen a
  floor, is unmeasured.
