# Cursor

Re-check when a Cursor release changes how it reads rules, `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, runs hooks
(its own or Claude Code's), or gates trust; before relying on a field name; and by 2026-12-27.

What Cursor loads and in what order, how its rules activate and which surfaces they reach, its
skills directories, its `stop` hook, the Claude Code files it reads and runs, and the configuration
that runs code. For anyone placing text or hooks where Cursor will load them, committing Claude
Code configuration to a repository Cursor users open. The comparison with other harnesses, the key findings (H1–H12) and the
evidence classes are in [cross-harness.md](cross-harness.md).

Rules read 2026-09-25, configuration 2026-09-27, hooks 2026-09-29; the rules docs, the rules help
page and the hooks pages re-read 2026-10-01 [harness-loading-coverage-17, grok-f1, grok-harness].
A claim read later than `last_checked` carries its date.

## 1. Instruction files and precedence

- **Files.** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with four activation modes; `AGENTS.md` at the root and nested;
  user rules and team rules [harness-loading-coverage-17].
- **Precedence.** "All applicable rules are merged; earlier sources take precedence when guidance
  conflicts", in the order Team, Project, User, so organisation rules outrank project rules; nested
  `AGENTS.md` files "are combined with parent directories, with more specific instructions taking
  precedence". L.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** [as-of 2026-10-01]. The rules page does not mention it, but the rules help page
  says Cursor "reads `CLAUDE.md` files the same way it reads `AGENTS.md`", picks up a root
  `CLAUDE.md` automatically, and applies it "to every conversation, regardless of any `alwaysApply`
  frontmatter setting", for compatibility with Claude Code. A `CLAUDE.md` written only for Claude
  Code therefore reaches Cursor's agent as well, and a `CLAUDE.md` holding `@AGENTS.md` is read as
  Cursor reads `AGENTS.md`. L.
- **What counts as a rule** [as-of 2026-10-01]. A project rule must be an `.mdc` file: "A plain
  `.md` file in `.cursor/rules` is ignored by the rules system", without a warning, because it has
  no frontmatter; the root `.cursorrules` file "is legacy and will be deprecated". Path-scoped rules
  carry `alwaysApply` and `globs` in their frontmatter. L.
- **Where rules reach.** Rules "only apply to Agent (Chat)", not to Tab completion, Inline Edit or
  Bugbot pull-request reviews, so those surfaces load none of the project's instructions (rules help
  page, read 2026-10-01). L.
- **Other harnesses read Cursor's files.** Grok Build reads `.cursor/rules` behind a compatibility
  toggle that defaults on ([others.md](others.md#grok-build-xai)); Cline reads `.cursorrules`
  ([others.md](others.md#cline)).

## 2. Caps

No enforced cap is documented. Advisory: keep rules under 500 lines
[harness-loading-coverage-17].

## 3. Skills

Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format, name and description preloaded and the body loaded on use, from
`.cursor/skills` and `.agents/skills` (project), `~/.agents/skills`, and, for compatibility,
`.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` (Cursor's skills page, read 2026-10-01). A skill installed in
`.agents/skills` for Codex, or in `.claude/skills` for Claude Code, is installed for Cursor too. L.

## 4. Hooks

### 4.1 The finish hook

Sources: <https://cursor.com/docs/hooks> (the same page as `/docs/agent/hooks`) and
<https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless>, read 2026-09-29 from the page source; the hooks page
re-read 2026-10-01 from its Markdown source. Marks: *doc*, *report*, `UNVERIFIED`, as in
[cross-harness.md](cross-harness.md#1-scope-method-and-evidence).

| Finish event | Holds the finish and returns a reason | Loop guard | Time limit | Project configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stop` (doc) | no hold: `followup_message` is submitted as the next user message after the loop ends (doc) | `loop_count`; `loop_limit`, default 5 (doc) | `timeout`, seconds, default not stated (`UNVERIFIED`) | `.cursor/hooks.json`, trusted workspaces and cloud agents (doc); also Claude Code's `.claude/settings*.json` hooks, on by default, with `loop_limit` `null`, no limit, which only Cursor's own format can set (doc); CLI support undocumented (`UNVERIFIED`) |

- `stop`: "Called when the agent loop ends. Can optionally auto-submit a follow-up user message to
  keep iterating." Input: `status` (`completed`, `aborted`, `error`) and `loop_count`, no `cwd`;
  every hook also receives `conversation_id`, `generation_id`, `model`, `hook_event_name`,
  `cursor_version`, `workspace_roots`, `user_email` and `transcript_path`. The process gets
  `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR`, "Workspace root directory". `subagentStop` is the same for a subagent.
- `followup_message`: "When provided and non-empty, Cursor will automatically submit it as the next
  user message." The loop has already ended; the message starts another. Exit code 2 blocks an
  action on the permission hooks, not here.
- `loop_count` "indicates how many times the stop hook has already triggered an automatic follow-up for this conversation (starts at 0)." The default limit is 5 auto follow-ups per script; the `loop_limit` option sets it, and `null` removes the cap.
- `timeout` in seconds, default "platform default", no number given.
- **Failure mode.** Hook failures "fail open by default" unless `failClosed: true`.
- **Configuration.** `<project-root>/.cursor/hooks.json`: "Project hooks run in any trusted
  workspace and are checked into version control with your project"; `~/.cursor/hooks.json`; team
  and enterprise layers above the project. "Cloud agents run command-based hooks from your
  repository."
- **The CLI.** Whether the CLI agent runs `stop` is not stated: the hooks page names the editor, Tab
  and cloud agents, and the headless CLI page does not mention hooks. robot-council/cli#72 and #83
  (2026-09) set out to measure it and record it as unsettled (report).

### 4.2 Claude Code's hooks run in Cursor

Third-party hooks page, <https://cursor.com/docs/reference/third-party-hooks>, read 2026-10-01. L.

- With "Include Third-Party Plugins, Skills, and Other Configs" on, which it is by default, Cursor
  loads hooks from `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/settings.json` and
  `~/.claude/settings.json`, below its own enterprise, team, project and user hooks; all matching
  hooks from every source run.
- It maps `Stop` to `stop` and treats a Claude Code `decision: "block"` with a `reason` as an
  automatic follow-up message; exit 2 blocks, other non-zero exits fail open.
- The hooks page gives `loop_limit` a default of 5 for Cursor hooks and `null`, no limit, for Claude
  Code hooks, and the third-party hooks page lists loop-limit configuration among the features
  available only in Cursor's native format. So a Claude Code finish hook that relies on Claude
  Code's 8-continuation cap has no cap in Cursor unless it checks its own guard or moves to
  `.cursor/hooks.json`. Whether that default loops in practice is unsettled.
- How Claude Code itself runs these hooks is in [claude-code.md](claude-code.md#71-the-finish-hook).

## 5. Settings that run code or widen permissions

Read 2026-09-27 (MCP and CLI permissions pages). "Executes" means the key names a command or
program the harness runs.

| Project files | Executes | Tool servers | Enables all servers | Endpoint overrides | Permission bypass | Deny rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.cursor/cli.json` | `hooks` | `mcpServers` | not settled | not settled | not settled | `permissions.deny` (in `.cursor/cli.json`) |

Cursor also runs the hooks in Claude Code's settings files (§4.2), so a repository's
`.claude/settings.json` is executable configuration for Cursor users too.

### 5.1 Editor permission files [as-of 2026-10-09]

The [permissions reference](https://prod.cursor.com/docs/reference/permissions), read 2026-10-09,
adds `.cursor/permissions.json` at user and workspace scope, loaded at startup and on changes.
Their allowlist arrays concatenate. Team Run Mode controls take precedence over these files,
which take precedence over IDE settings; a file's defined allowlist replaces the corresponding IDE list,
including an empty list. Permission files require an enabled run mode. Only Auto-review mode
uses `autoRun` `allow_instructions` and `block_instructions` to steer its classifier; they do not
enforce a security boundary, and calls covered by block instructions can still be approved. The page describes the controls as
convenience checks. CLI permissions have separate semantics from this editor configuration. No
minimum version is given for the current behavior; runtime enforcement was not tested. L.

## 6. Trust and readers that load nothing

- Project hooks run "in any trusted workspace"; cloud agents run a repository's command hooks
  (§4.1).
- Tab completion, Inline Edit and Bugbot pull-request reviews load no rules (§1), so a request or a
  review there gets no project rules unless it carries them itself.

## 7. Sessions, worktrees and models

- Cursor manages its own worktrees per machine, keeping at most 25 per machine and cleaning up
  every 6 hours ([agent-workspace.md](../practices/agent-workspace.md#2-worktrees-and-working-files-w1-volatile)).
  Where it keeps sessions was not read for this reference.
- Cursor has been a SpaceX subsidiary since 2026-08-14, and with Grok Build is the only place
  serving Grok 4.7 Fast [grok-trend, grok-g12]. Grok 4.5–4.7 were co-trained with Cursor data
  ([cross-harness.md](cross-harness.md#132-the-documented-direction)).
- **SDK delegation** [as-of 2026-10-09]. The
  [SDK release notes](https://prod.cursor.com/docs/release-notes/sdk), read 2026-10-09, add opt-in
  `local.subagentInherit` in 1.0.34: local TypeScript Task subagents inherit custom read, write and
  shell executors, workspace reporting, and allowed and excluded tool lists. The unset default
  retains prior behavior. Version 1.0.35 adds `context.sessionId` to TypeScript custom-tool
  `execute`, identifying the calling session, including a child's own ID; it can be unset when
  the runtime has no session ID. The 1.0.27 notes say local tool restrictions are
  not persisted across resume. These features describe executor routing and attribution, not an
  OS sandbox or a grant of authority (inference). They were not tested here. L.
- At-work adoption was 12% in May–July 2026, down from 18% in January, in one vendor-run survey
  ([cross-harness.md](cross-harness.md#12-adoption-monitor)).

## 8. Rendering and surface signals

- Since 2026-02-18 the Cursor CLI renders a reply's Mermaid block inline as ASCII (changelog); for
  Cursor's agent chat it is unknown [as-of 2026-09-23]. Cursor's 2.2 changelog (2025-12-10) says
  Plan Mode supports inline Mermaid diagrams; those are plans, not replies in chat (read
  2026-10-01).
- Cursor sets `CURSOR_AGENT` in the commands its agent runs. As a host editor it also sets its own
  variables for every extension, so a Claude Code extension session inside Cursor carries
  `CURSOR_LAYOUT`, `CURSOR_WORKSPACE_LABEL` and `VSCODE_PID`, and a terminal it opens may inherit
  `CURSOR_AGENT` (A, observed 2026-09-23). Match on the most specific set of variables
  ([cross-harness.md](cross-harness.md#11-rendering-in-harness-surfaces)).

## 9. Production harness and rollout reports [as-of 2026-10-09]

Cursor's reports of 2026-09-23 describe changes to context assembly and new deployment monitoring.
The claims and limits are recorded once in
[the harness ablation](../practices/writing-for-models.md#97-a-production-harness-ablation-as-of-2026-10-09)
and [the rollout workflow](../practices/releasing.md#10-evidence-after-deployment-and-paid-service-bounds-volatile-as-of-2026-10-09).
These are vendor reports (L), read 2026-10-09; they do not establish that the rule-loading and hook
behavior above changed.
